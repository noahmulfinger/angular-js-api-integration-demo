# ArcGIS REST JS and ArcGIS Javascript API Integration

View live demo here: https://angular-js-api-integration-demo.stackblitz.io/

This Angular CLI demo uses [ArcGIS REST JS](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js) for signing a user in to their ArcGIS Online account and querying all their feature services. Then, they can add any of the services to the map displayed by the [ArcGIS JavaScript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript). The user's signed in state is passed from the UserSession of REST JS to the JS API's IdentityManager.
